        <!-- Design Value -->
        <div class="deisgnValue">
            <h2>Design Value:</h2>
            <h3>Minimalism:</h3>
            <p>The minimalist approach of this design is defined by no textual elements, I wanted the interface to rely only on images and icons. Each button uses emojis that clearly show its meaning without needing words. This makes the layout simple and keeps things visually clean.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The large looping background video helps avoid empty white spaces and creates a full, engaging screen. All the UI panels, like video and sound options, sit neatly on top of the video. By keeping these controls inside panels, the main interface stays uncluttered and lets users focus on the timer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also used grey tones and added transparency to buttons and sections. This softens the overall look, reduces harsh color contrast, and keeps the design light and minimal.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Immersion:</h3>
            <p>The looping background videos are designed to feel like real spaces, such as the rain falling, caf√© corners, forest paths, or city roads. These visuals, paired with layered ambient sounds like wind, birds, rain, or thunder, create a realistic and immersive soundscape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The smooth animation of the hidden panel helps users stay in that immersive mood, since the transitions don‚Äôt break the flow. The transparent analog clock and timer also blend naturally with the videos, keeping the visuals seamless and avoiding distractions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Personalization:</h3>
            <p>Users can choose different looped videos for their background, for example, a bedroom, caf√©, forest, living room, or snow house, depending on what mood they want.</p>
            <br>
            <p>They can also mix and match ambient sounds to create their own soundscape, layering different elements together to fit their personal taste.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The timer is fully adjustable, so users can set their own focus time in minutes. It shows both minutes and seconds for more accuracy.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- Rationale -->
        <div class="rationale">
            <h2>Rationale - Design Principle</h2>
            <!-- Feedback -->
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <h4>Sound Control</h4>
            <p>The icon button changes to show the mute and unmute states: üîá with a red cross represents muted, and üîä means unmuted. The slider controls the volume of each individual sound track. Since there are multiple tracks, the sliders do not display numbers. The position of the sliders provides visual feedback of the current volume level. This intentional design ensures the sound will not startle users when it begins playing. Additionally, a pop-up reminder appears when entering the website to notify users about the sound.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Date/Time</h4>
            <p>The analog clock provides continuous visual feedback of time passing. The thickness of the clock hands differentiates the hour, minute, and second. Below the analog clock, there is also a numerical date and time, which provides textual feedback. This display corresponds to real-life time, reassuring users that the system is accurate. This aspect is extremely useful for Macbook users, as when entering full screen mode, the top bar will automatically be hidden, and to check the time Macbook users will have to move their mouse. It avoids users from breaking the immersion. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Timer</h4>
            <p> The countdown timer updates every second, providing an accurate and familiar way to display remaining time. When the timer ends, a pop-up alert gives explicit feedback to notify the user that the countdown has finished. The two control buttons (‚Äúplay/pause, restart‚Äù) allow the user to change the behavior of the timer at any stage, ensuring flexibility during the timing process.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Video Panel</h4>
            <p>A video panel is included to let users choose any background footage they like. By clicking the buttons, each one loads a different looping video scene, providing visual feedback that the environment has changed. Double-clicking a video button closes the panel to its minimal stage, giving users control over its visibility.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- Information Design -->
            <h3>Information Design</h3>
            <p>The information design in my project includes buttons, sliders, and visual displays.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Buttons are designed with attention to size, color, and alignment. The color scheme is harmonious with the background videos, and the sizing ensures readability, hierarchy, and visual aesthetics.</li>
                <li>Sliders are designed with the same considerations but specifically communicate range from minimum to maximum. Sliding left lowers the volume and sliding right raises it, following conventions familiar across many cultures.</li>
                <li>Visual Displays include three major elements: the date/time, the background video, and the overall layout of the panels. Important techniques I used in my information design include size, color, alignment, and the use of positive and negative space.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- mapping -->
            <h3>Mapping</h3>
            <p> In the ‚ÄúStudy Space‚Äù section, mapping is clearly demonstrated through the sliders and buttons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dragging the slider to the right increases the volume in direct proportion to the percentage shown, making the interaction intuitive and easy to navigate.</li>
                <li>Video switching happens quickly and accurately without errors, meaning the screen responds directly to the user‚Äôs input. This close relationship between controls (input) and outcomes (function) ensures accurate mapping.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <!-- Significant Changes -->
        <div class="changes">
            <h2>Significant Changes:</h2>
            <h3>Original Interface</h3>
            <img src="IMG1.png" alt="Orininalinterface" class="IMG1">
            <p>I have made changes around the video panel, sound panel, timer panel and the Analog clock. </p>
            <h3>Video Section</h3>
            <p>The most significant change I made to the Video Panel is adding a sliding feature. The panel now only appears when the video button is clicked, sliding in from the right side of the interface. This keeps the layout clean and prevents the panel from taking up too much space on the main screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also adjusted the size of each button and added clearer hover feedback. When users hover over an icon, the background color changes and the button slightly enlarges. This makes it easier for users to see which button they‚Äôre interacting with and navigate the panel more intuitively.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to remove one of the ‚ÄúBed‚Äù looped videos because I didn‚Äôt want to have repeated icons. It was hard to choose between the two, but I ended up keeping the darker scene as the default background video. Personally, I think it feels more immersive and helps create a stronger sense of being in that space. It also blends better with the grey transparent buttons in the interface.</p>
            <img src="IMG2.png" alt="InitialBackground">
            <h5>Initial Background</h5>
            <h3>Sound Section</h3>
            <p>I made similar changes to the Sound Panel by creating a foldable panel. From the feedback I received, some users mentioned the clarity of the soundtracks, so I decided to remove two of them, the ‚Äúcricket‚Äù and ‚Äúpencil writing‚Äù sounds. These were meant to match the ‚Äúforest‚Äù and ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù scenes, but I think they can also be replaced with other sounds that still give a sense of realism and skeuomorphism.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also made the mute/unmute button, sliders, and icons bigger to make them more readable and easier to understand. Since my interface follows the ‚ÄúNo Text Character‚Äù prompt, clarity was definitely a challenge, so I focused on keeping the UI simple and intuitive.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A default sound now plays automatically as a hint to let users know that the website includes audio. The ‚Äúnote‚Äù button at the bottom left allows users to mute or unmute the sounds, and they can also layer different sounds together to create their own personalized soundspace.</p>
            <h3>Time Section</h3>
            <p>The most significant change I made is the time display in the timer section. I moved the numerical display outside of the box and made it very large, with transparency so it blends with the background while keeping both elements visible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I also reduced the number of buttons from four to two. I removed the ‚Äúset timer‚Äù and ‚Äúpause‚Äù buttons, combining their functions into a single ‚Äúplay/pause‚Äù button. When users press the play button, the icon changes to pause and the timer starts immediately. I kept the repeat button because I thought it could still be useful. </p>
            <img src="IMG3.png" alt="old">
            <img src="IMG4.png" alt="new">
            <p>The colored borders were removed, and I added hover feedback: when the user hovers over a button, the background color changes, giving clear visual feedback about which button is being hovered.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A subtle but important change is that when users enter the time, the numerical display updates in real time, so they can see the timer they‚Äôre setting in large, clear numbers at the center of the interface. I also placed the button to the right of the input field on the same horizontal line, so it looks like one combined unit rather than having the button below the textbox.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For the Analog Clock, since it‚Äôs a key element to showcase my ‚Äúskeuomorphism‚Äù prompt, I intentionally exaggerated its size and adjusted the colors slightly, not too much, but enough to make it more visually pleasing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="designAspect">
            <h2>Deisgn Aspects</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôm most proud of the UI/UX design of the immersive interface. The UI elements and tools create a calm and immersive environment, and with the ambient sounds, users can enjoy a personalized soundscape. The timing tool also helps prevent distractions. Both of these aspects were my main goals when designing this website, so I‚Äôm really proud of how the visuals, sounds, and interactions all work together.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The most challenging part of designing this website was creating an interface that users can understand immediately without text. To address this, I added an information panel before users enter the main interface, which includes a welcoming message, instructions, and references for the videos and sounds. Based on feedback, clarity was a big issue for many elements, so I had to adjust the size multiple times to ensure readability and use techniques like foldable panels to make the interface easier to navigate.</p>
